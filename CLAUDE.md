# Leadsure — Claude Code Project Instructions

## Workflow
- The live site is at https://leadsure.com, hosted on GitHub Pages (chad506/Leadsure, main branch)
- GitHub token is stored in the remote URL — push with `git push origin main` directly
- After every code change: commit and push immediately so the live site updates

## Site Structure
- `index.html` — main positions dashboard (uses app3.js)
- `fund-results.html` — full fund results with sold/addon positions
- `picks-history.html` — AI model picks history table
- `fund-data.js` — single source of truth for positions, prices, sold positions
- `model-picks-data.js` — all AI model picks (5 models, see below)
- `app3.js` — main dashboard JS (Finnhub live prices, P&L, charts)

## Account Hero (above KPI tiles)
Total Account Value | Cash Invested | Today's P&L ($ + %) | Total P&L | ROI
IDs: hero-account-value, hero-cash-invested, hero-today-pnl, hero-total-pnl, hero-roi

## KPI Tiles (index.html, in order — 8 tiles, 4×2)
Alpha vs S&P 500 | S&P 500 % | Mag 7 % | Positions |
Long Exposure | Short Exposure | Sortino | Sharpe

## Deployment
- DNS: Cloudflare (nameservers), A records point to GitHub Pages IPs
- HTTPS cert: GitHub Pages Let's Encrypt (may need enabling via API after DNS changes)
- Enable HTTPS: `curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" https://api.github.com/repos/chad506/Leadsure/pages -d '{"https_enforced":true}'`

## Adding New Picks

### Pick object format
```js
{
  symbol: 'TICK',
  name: 'Full Company Name',
  industry: 'Specific Niche — be descriptive',
  marketCap: 1234567890,         // number in dollars
  direction: 'Long',             // or 'Short'
  dateChosen: '6/17',            // M/DD format
  qty: 22,                       // floor(10000 / price), rounded to whole shares
  price: 440.87,                 // entry price (actual buy price)
  livePrice: 440.87,             // set = price on entry (Finnhub updates it live)
  prevClose: 425.83,             // prior day's close: price - (dayChng$ / qty)
  rationale: 'Detailed thesis...'
}
```

### qty formula
`qty = Math.floor(10000 / price)` — target ~$10,000 per position. Round to nearest sensible lot.

### prevClose calculation
From the Google Sheet's "Day Chng $" column: `prevClose = currentPrice - (dayChng$ / qty)`.
Or: prior day's closing price from any financial data source.

### livePrice on entry
Set `livePrice = price` when first entering the pick. Finnhub live prices update it automatically.

### After adding picks to a model, update these 4 things:
1. **`totalTrades`** in that model's object — increment by number of new picks added
2. **Header comment** at top of file — add `| Week N: Month DD, YYYY` to the chain
3. **`MODEL_PICKS.date`** — append the new date(s) to the date string
4. **Week registry** — the header comment is the canonical week log; keep it up to date

### Week numbering
Week 1 = March 6, 2026. As of 6/17 we are on Week 36. Each set of picks on a new date = new week entry.

## Updating Fund Positions (fund-data.js)
- Source of truth for positions is `fund-data.js` → `POSITIONS` array
- When new buys happen, also update:
  - `fund-results.html` → `ENTRY_DATES` lookup (add symbol + entry date)
  - `picks-history.html` → `FUND_SYMBOLS` set (add symbol for LIVE badge)
  - `model-picks-data.js` → add picks entry for the recommending model + date
- The live Google Sheet with positions: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xwFFS6OkC9Frp2-mOuIMqxh7z_mXXNxE-Lc8-uP3Urk/export?format=csv&gid=251449467
- New positions appear at the bottom of the first table in the sheet

## Prices
- `PRICES_AS_OF` in fund-data.js must match today's date (YYYY-MM-DD Pacific time)
- `prevClose` = prior day's close (compute from sheet's Day Chng $ ÷ qty + current price)
- Finnhub API key: `d6kqa11r01qmopd1net0d6kqa11r01qmopd1netg`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Never set qty based on a wrong price** — always verify the entry price is correct before computing qty. If a stock hasn't traded at a given price in years, it's wrong.
- **livePrice ≠ buy price after time passes** — on entry set livePrice = price; never update it manually after that (Finnhub handles it).
- **prevClose is NOT the same as price** — compute it from actual prior-day close data.
- **totalTrades must be incremented** — easy to forget; each new pick adds 1 to that model's totalTrades.
